# The Fizz Buzz application

## Fizz Buzz API

You must simulate a FizzBuzz API.
When you pass it a number, it returns:

- "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
- "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
- the number (as string) in other cases

## Fizz Buzz page

Create a page where a user can enter a number and when he presses a send button, the result of the FizzBuzz operation is printed on the screen.

The result shuold be printed like this:

- if the value is "Fizz" the background is red
- if the value is "Buzz" the background is green
- if the value is "FizzBuzz" the background is blue
- the background is white in other cases

## Make the API asynchrone

Make the FizzBuzz API async by adding a 5s delay before returning the response.

Adapt all the code to handle the async API.
